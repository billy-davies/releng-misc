## Overview

The goal of this project is to collect the various tools (script, config, notes, etc.) we've been using to assist with RELENG-      related activities.  The purpose is to establish **awareness** of these tools.

**WARNING** Things collected here may be broken, full of bugs, hard to use, and out-of-date.   Don't assume that anything here is   suitable to use in production without inspecting and testing it first.


## Contributing

* If you'd like to contribute something that you've been using, drop it in a new folder (preferrably with a small README.md to let  others know what it is).
* Don't let polishing things hold you up from contributing
